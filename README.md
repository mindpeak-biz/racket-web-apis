# racket-web-apis
CRUD Web APIS written in Racket

Witin the first day of using Racket, I enjoyed the language so much that I decided to seriously evaluate it 
as the platform for writting the web APIS for a commercial poject I have.

If you're new to Racket, or just looking into it out of curiosity, I hope you find this code (however brief and limited), to be an incentive to explore web development with Racket. 


Discalimer:
-----------
At the time of this repository being created (March 25, 2021) I had less than 20 hours experience with Racket. 
I've written this file (app.rkt) as an experiment to see just how productive I can be in only a very short time with the language.
In fact, I volunteered to give a short talk on a topic I find to be useful (since most developers at least tinker with web development), and to show other Racket novices that the initial learning curve is quite gentle.
