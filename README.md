CRUD Web APIS written in Racket

Within just the first day of using Racket, I enjoyed the language, platform, and IDE so much that I decided to seriously evaluate it 
as the platform for writting the web APIS for a commercial project I have.

If you're new to Racket, or just looking into it out of curiosity, I hope you find this code (however brief and limited), to be an incentive to explore web development with Racket. 

This repository is currently extremely limited (only having devoted 2 days to learning Racket so far), but will grow over time. I will keep adding code snippets to it - that will hopefully be usefull to others. 


How to use this code:
---------------------
1 - Clone the repo to your computer
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
2 - Download and install Racket (and DrRacket - an IDE for Racket) for your OS (https://download.racket-lang.org/)
3 - Launch DrRacket
4 - Open the app.rkt file (from the cloned repo) in DrRacket and run it by clicking the green arrow on the top right of the IDE
5 - Just experiment and have fun


Discalimer:
-----------
At the time of this repository being created (March 25, 2021) I had less than 20 hours experience with Racket. 
I've written this file (app.rkt) as an experiment to see just how productive I can be in only a very short time with the language.
In fact, I even volunteered to give a short talk at this year's Racketfest (https://racketfest.com/) on a topic I find to be useful (i.e. web API development) - since most developers at least tinker with web development.
